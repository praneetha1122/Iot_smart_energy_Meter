## 1.Project Overview
This project implements an IoT-based Smart Energy Meter that measures electrical parameters such as voltage, current, power, energy units, and total cost. The data is displayed locally on an I2C LCD and remotely monitored using the Blynk Web Dashboard** through Wi-Fi.
The system is built using an ESP32 microcontroller, making it suitable for smart home and energy management applications.



## 2. Components Required
* ESP32 Development Board
* ACS712 Current Sensor
* ZMPT101B Voltage Sensor Module
* 16×2 I2C LCD Display
* Breadboard
* Connecting Wires
* Load (Bulb)
* Power Supply
* USB Cable



## 3. Conceptual Block Diagram 
Load → Current Sensor → ESP32 → LCD Display & Blynk Cloud



## 4. Wiring Connections
### 4.1 Voltage Sensor to ESP32
* VCC → ESP32 VCC (3.3V / 5V as per module)
* GND → ESP32 GND
* OUT → GPIO 35 (ADC pin)

### 4.2 Current Sensor (ACS712) to ESP32
* VCC → ESP32 VCC
* GND → ESP32 GND
* OUT → GPIO 34 (ADC pin)

### 4.3 I2C LCD Display to ESP32
* VCC → ESP32 VCC
* GND → ESP32 GND
* SDA → GPIO 21
* SCL → GPIO 22

### 4.4 Load Connection
* Connect the bulb (load) in series with the current sensor
* Connect the ZMPT101B voltage sensor across the main power supply

### 4.5 Programming Connection
* Connect ESP32 to the computer using a USB cable for uploading code



## 5. Working Principle
1. The ZMPT101B voltage sensor measures the line voltage.
2. The ACS712 current sensor measures the current drawn by the load.
3. ESP32 reads analog values and calculates:
   * Voltage (V)
   * Current (A)
   * Power (W = V × I)
   * Energy Consumption (Units in kWh)
   * Total Cost (based on tariff)
4. Values are displayed on the 16×2 LCD.
5. The same data is sent to the Blynk Web Dashboard for real-time monitoring.



## 6. Blynk Web Dashboard Configuration
### 6.1 Create Blynk Template
* Go to Blynk Cloud → New Template
* Template Name: *Smart Energy Meter*
* Hardware: ESP32
* Connection Type: Wi-Fi

### 6.2 Create Datastreams (Virtual Pins)
| Parameter    | Virtual Pin | Unit        |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| Voltage      | V0          | Volts (V)   |
| Current      | V1          | Amperes (A) |
| Power        | V2          | Watts (W)   |
| Energy Units | V3          | kWh         |
| Total Cost   | V4          | Currency    |

### 6.3 Dashboard Setup
* Add Gauge Widgets for:
  * Voltage
  * Current
  * Power
  * Energy Units
  * Total Cost
* Assign each widget to its corresponding virtual pin
* Customize labels, ranges, and colors

### 6.4 Credentials
Copy the following from Blynk:
* Template ID
* Template Name
* Auth Token
These credentials are used in the Arduino code.
